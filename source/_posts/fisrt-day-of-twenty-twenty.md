# Glimpses Of The World Ahead
**Most science fiction is not predictive. Yet it can still be a guide to the future**
IN "THE HIGH GROUND", an episode of "Star Trek: The next generation"first aired in 1990, a
crew member of the starship Enterprise is taken hostage by separatists on the planet Rutia
IV. As her colleagues discuss how best to repond, one of them draws an analogy with a
confict on Earth several centuries earlier-the Troubles in Northern Ireland-nothing that
they were ultimately resolved by "the Irish unification of 2024"  
As the 2020s dawn ,the upheaval of Brexit means the prospect of Irish reunification no
longer seems like science fiction.
